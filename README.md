# Inochi Creator
An in-progress rigging application for Inochi2D.
Written in D using GTK, imgui and Inochi2D.

# Building on Linux
Just run `dub build`

# Building on Windows
To build on Windows you will need to have Visual Studio 2017 installed, we're using `rc.exe` from it to include the icons.

If you do not wish to install Visual Studio 2017 you can build the project with the `winapp-noicon` configuration.
